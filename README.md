Recita is a tool I made to make recitations more organized. 
It's mobile-friendly, so while you're asking the real questions, your hand can take note of your students' answers through Recita.

There still are a lot of clutters so I'll clean that up in the future.
You can use the guest mode (i.e. the no log-in or sign-up method) and export data via .csv.
However, you can create an account to keep track of classes, students, and multiple recitas.

I would like to have a "sections" feature but that's too complicated. 
I'll try that out next time.
